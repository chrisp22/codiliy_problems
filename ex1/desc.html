<p>An integer X and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers are given. We are interested in which elements of A are equal to X and which are different from X. The goal is to split array A into two parts, such that the number of elements equal to X in the first part is the same as the number of elements different from X in the other part. More formally, we are looking for a number K such that:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>0 ≤ K ≤ N, and</li>
<li>the number of elements equal to X in A[0..K−1] is the same as the number of elements different from X in A[K..N−1]. (For K = 0, A[0..K−1] does not contain any elements. For K = N, A[K..N−1] does not contain any elements.)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>For example, given integer X = 5 and array A such that:</p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  A[0] = 5
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 7
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 3
  A[6] = 5</tt>
<p>K equals 4, because:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>two of the elements of A[0..3] are equal to X, namely A[0] = A[1] = X, and</li>
<li>two of the elements of A[4..6] are different from X, namely A[4] and A[5].</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Write a function:</p>
<blockquote><p class="lang-js" style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>function solution(X, A);</tt></p></blockquote>
<p>that, given an integer X and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the value of number K satisfying the above conditions. It can be shown such index K always exists and it is unique.</p>
<p>For example, given integer X and array A as above, the function should return 4, as explained above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
<li>X is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
<li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>].</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Complexity:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</li>
<li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
